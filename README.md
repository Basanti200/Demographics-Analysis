# Demographics Analysis with Python

Demographics analysis involves examining the characteristics of a population based on factors such as age, gender, location, income, education, and more. It helps businesses and organizations understand their audience, tailor marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and make informed decisions. This repository provides a guide on how to perform demographics analysis using Python.

## Overview

Demographics analysis is a crucial task that involves understanding the composition of a websiteâ€™s audience based on various demographic factors such as age, gender, location, and interests. The insights gained from demographics analysis can include:

- Detailed understanding of who the visitors are.
- How different demographic groups interact with the site.
